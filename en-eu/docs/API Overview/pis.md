## Base URL
The base URL for all PIS APIs is: `https://rs1.openbanking.clearbankgb.com/open-banking/v3.1/pisp/**`

## Supported Payment Types
ClearBank's Open Banking API powered by Ozone currently only supports
- Domestic Payments
- Payment Detail Endpoints

ClearBank's Open Banking API powered by Ozone **does not** support:
- International Payments
- File & Bulk Payments
- Domestic Scheduled Payments
- Domestic Standing Orders

## Overview
The following fields are mandatory for all domestic payment consents:

### `InstructedAmount/Amount`
The ClearBank Open Banking API mandates no maximum amount in `InstructedAmount/Amount`. It is possible that a `domestic-payment-consents` is authorised, but the payment initiation fails due to account limits.

### `InstructedAmount/Currency`
`InstructedAmount/Currency` must be `EUR` for EEA-based transactions. 

### `RemittanceInformation/Reference`
`RemittanceInformation/Reference` is a mandatory field and must adhere to the following:
- Valid characters:
  - A-Z
  - a-z
  - 0-9
  - "space"
  - The characters "&", "-", ".", "/"
  
- Contiguous characters – user enters 6 or more valid characters but without contiguous string of at least 6 alphanumeric characters
- Must contain a contiguous string of at least 6 alphanumeric characters
- Homogeneous string – user enters 6 or more valid characters (including valid non-alphanumeric characters) - After stripping out non-alphanumeric characters the resulting string cannot consist of all the same character

The PISP may also opt to populate reference field on behalf of the PSU.

### `CreditorAccount`
Domestic-payment-consents will only be authorised if the `CreditorAccount` details are sent or received. If a consent contains recipient info that does not meet this criteria then an error will be returned to the front end, the consent will remain in status `AwaitingAuthorisation` and the PSU will not be redirected.

### `Account.SchemeName`
The only supported `Account.SchemeName` is `UK.OBIE.SortCodeAccountNumber` for both `DebtorAccount` and `CreditorAccount`. Any other enum provided will return error.
