## Getting started

We recommend that you start off by accessing our [Sandbox](https://developer.sandbox.clrb.uk-hub-prod.ozoneapi.co.uk/en-eu/docs/40-sandbox.md).

Our ClearBank Sandbox powered by Ozone fully reflects the production environment and provides an easy route to testing out your proposition.

To access the production environment, you must be a TPP authorised by the FCA or passported into the UK. Instructions for accessing our Production APIs are [here](https://developer.sandbox.clrb.uk-hub-prod.ozoneapi.co.uk/en-eu/docs/30-production.md).
