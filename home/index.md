## Open Banking

ClearBank is a FCA registered Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP) providing access to open banking services based on the Open Banking standard. 

The ClearBank Open Banking API powered by Ozone is based on the Open Banking Standard which allows regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access Account Information Services (AIS), Payment Initiation Services (PIS) and funds confirmation requests for eligible member accounts.

This Ozone Sandbox has been created by [Ozone](https://ozoneapi.com) to enable developers to build and test open banking enabled applications.

Access to these services on behalf of members is controlled by strong customer authentication within ClearBankClearBankClearBank apps as part of OpenID Connect authorisation flows. ClearBank currently supports web authentication flows.
